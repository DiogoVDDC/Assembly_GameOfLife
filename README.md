Button Mapping:
1) button 0 is the start/pause button. If pressed, the game toggles between play and pause.
2) button 1 increases the speed of the game.
3) button 2 decreases the speed of the game.
4) button 3 is the reset button. It clears the initial board selection, the number of steps, and stops
the game.
5) button 4 replaces the current game state with a new random one
